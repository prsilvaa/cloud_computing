<h2>Project Objective</h2>
<p>To configure and test read/write access from an EC2 Linux instance to an S3 bucket by assigning proper IAM role permissions. This involves creating and configuring the S3 bucket, launching an EC2 instance, attaching IAM roles, and using AWS CLI commands to verify access. The solution ensures secure data exchange between EC2 and S3 services within the AWS environment.</p>

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>AWS Academy Learner Lab â€“ Foundation Services</li>
    <li>AWS IAM</li>
    <li>Amazon EC2</li>
    <li>Amazon S3</li>
    <li>AWS CLI</li>
    <li>Linux Commands</li>
</ul>

<h2>Skills Gained</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Configuring IAM roles and permissions</li>
    <li>Managing EC2 instances</li>
    <li>Creating and managing S3 buckets</li>
    <li>Using AWS CLI for S3 operations</li>
    <li>Linux terminal operations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>Successful access to the S3 bucket from the EC2 Linux instance was achieved by verifying permissions using AWS CLI commands. The required text file was accessed and successfully copied from the S3 bucket to the EC2 instance using AWS CLI and Linux commands, confirming read and write permissions were correctly configured through the attached IAM role.</p>
